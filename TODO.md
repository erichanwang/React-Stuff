# TODO: Revamp Tic Tac Toe UI and Add AI Mode

- [x] Update styles.css with new UI styles (bigger board, centered layout, modern design) - Used inline styles in App.jsx since styles.css was empty
- [x] Modify App.jsx to add game mode selection (Player vs Player or Player vs AI)
- [x] Implement minimax AI algorithm in App.jsx for AI moves
- [x] Update Board component to handle AI turns automatically
- [ ] Test the application by running the dev server and playing the game
